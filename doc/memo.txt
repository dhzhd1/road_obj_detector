Based on the experience, we need more testing data to training this network.
So I plan to add blur image into this dataset, since the road environment is complicated.
Gaussian Blur: This kind of blur image will simulate the mist, rainy day.
Median Blur: This kind will create some noise to simulate when the camera had some dirty spots.
